## Well met 👋 🦕

I am glad you made it. While you are here, feel free to take a look around. Each of my repos showcase a specific concept or feature of development I am putting into practice.
All my repos are waiting for the first releases on their main branches and that is no mistake. I share all my sidequests with you so we can both enjoy the first deployment together.


- ⌨️ I’m currently working on building static libraries, writing unit tests, designing a 2D game engine, and becoming a C++ main.
- 🧠 I’m currently learning about CI/CD pipelines, software architecture, and how to bargain with CMake.
- 💬 Ask me about about being a mental health counselor turned C++ programmer, who also identifies synapsid fossils.
- 🧶⛓️ Fun fact: Crocheting is the gateway to chainmaille.
